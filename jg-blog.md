## Sink or Swim!
### _Surviving My First Day of Code School_

Things started out a bit bumpy when we missed the step of working in VS Code. We built our [Hello-World](file:///Users/jillianlg/Desktop/hello-world/hello-world.html) web page in our main terminal only to discover that thing weren't able to connect to the text editor. It took a bit of sluthing and asking around but we eventually figured out where we went wrong. 

Brian has been an **amazing** pairing partner. We seem to have a similar communication style as well as approcah to problem solving. It's been **extreamly** helpful to bounce ideas and navigate the project together. 

The ambiguity of the day is a bit of a challange. I am realizing the not knowing what our pace should be or if we are falling behind is a bit aniexty provoking.

### _Past and Present_

wereWell, this paragraph was going to be about how my next steps as a programer are a bit unknown. However, given that my computer just crashed I think my next steps might be that I need a new computer!!

Prior to COVID-19 I worked in the event management industry. I managed the operations for large scale coperate conferance and C-level summints. We worked with all types of clients:
* Google
* AWS 
* Amazon
* Uber
* Sales Force

Before we were furloughed I was working with the IT team to develop an Event App that would make the work we were did more time and cost efficcent as well as enviromentally concious. I was having a blast helping to leading the beta testing team, communicating with the developers and exploring the world of programing. When we were laid-off persuing code school seems to be the logical next step!

Where I go from here is pretty open. I am interested in being a programer, a scrum master or even a project manager.
